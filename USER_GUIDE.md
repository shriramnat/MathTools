# User Guide

MathCanvas is a math practice app where children solve arithmetic problems by writing answers directly on the screen. A parent or teacher configures the practice from the top bar.

## Getting Started

Open the app in a web browser. The screen shows a grid of math problems, each on its own card. Children write their answers directly on the cards using a finger, stylus, or mouse.

The top bar at the top of the screen contains all settings and drawing tools.

---

## The Top Bar

The top bar has three sections. On mobile and tablet devices, the settings section is collapsed behind a hamburger menu (☰) — tap it to expand.

### Row 1: Title and Menu

- **🧮 MathCanvas** — app title
- **☰ Menu button** (mobile/tablet only) — expands or collapses the settings panel

### Row 2: Practice Settings

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **+ − ×** buttons | Toggle which operations to practice. At least one must be active. |
| **Digits slider** (1–6) | Sets the maximum number of digits per operand. Higher = harder problems. |
| **Easy / Medium / Hard** | Controls problem difficulty (see [Difficulty Levels](#difficulty-levels)). |
| **Free / Session** | Switches between Free Practice and Session mode. |
| **Guides** checkbox | Toggles guided mode with helper lines. |
| **Theme buttons** (☁️🌲🌅💜) | Changes the app's color theme. |

### Row 3: Drawing Tools

Always visible. See [Drawing Tools](#drawing-tools) below.

---

## Drawing Tools

The drawing toolbar provides everything needed for writing on problem cards.

### Pen and Eraser

- **✏️ Pen** — draws with the selected color and size
- **🧽 Eraser** — erases ink strokes

The active tool is highlighted. Only one tool can be active at a time.

### Color Palette

Eight colors are available: black, blue, red, green, purple, orange, teal, and pink.

Tap a color to select it. **Selecting a color automatically switches to pen mode** if the eraser was active.

The selected color is shown with a larger, highlighted circle.

### Brush Size

A slider controls the stroke width (1–12 pixels). A preview dot next to the slider shows the current size.

### Card-Level Controls

Each problem card also has two small buttons:

- **↩ Undo** — removes the last stroke drawn on that card
- **🗑 Clear** — erases all ink on that card

---

## Practice Modes

### Free Practice

The default mode. An infinite scrolling grid of problems appears on screen. New problems are generated as you scroll down. There is no time limit and no scoring.

Use this mode for casual, pressure-free practice.

### Session Mode

A structured practice mode for focused work.

1. **Select session size** — choose 10, 15, or 20 problems from the dropdown
2. **Tap ▶ Start** — the session begins and a timer starts counting
3. **Solve the problems** — work through the fixed set of problems
4. **Tap ✓ Finished Problems** — a confirmation dialog appears asking if you're done
5. **Confirm** — the timer stops and the session enters checking mode
6. **Check answers** — use the check panel on each card (see [Checking Answers](#checking-answers))
7. **Tap ■ End Session** — finishes the session and returns to free practice

**During a session:**
- The timer displays elapsed time
- Settings that would change the problem set (operations, digits, difficulty) are locked
- The problem count is fixed — no infinite scrolling

---

## Checking Answers

Each problem card includes a parent checking panel (when check mode is set to Manual).

### How to Check

On each problem card, a parent can:

1. **Reveal Answer** — shows the correct answer below the separator line in green
2. **Mark ✓ Correct** — records the problem as correct (green badge appears)
3. **Mark ✗ Incorrect** — records the problem as incorrect (red badge appears)

### Check Results

- A **green ✓ badge** appears on correctly answered problems
- A **red ✗ badge** appears on incorrectly answered problems
- Problems with no check action are considered **Skipped**

In Session mode, these results contribute to the session summary.

---

## Difficulty Levels

### Easy

- Addition problems avoid carrying (no digit-by-digit overflow)
- Subtraction problems avoid borrowing
- Multiplication uses a single-digit second operand
- Both operands have the same number of digits

Best for: beginners, building confidence.

### Medium

- Carrying and borrowing are allowed
- Multiplication allows up to 2 digits for the second operand
- Operands can have different digit counts

Best for: children comfortable with basic operations.

### Hard

- Full difficulty within the selected digit range
- Multiplication can use the full digit range for both operands
- Operands can have different digit counts

Best for: advanced practice and challenge.

---

## Guided Mode

Toggle the **Guides** checkbox to enable visual scaffolding on problem cards.

When enabled, each problem card shows:

- **Faint vertical column lines** below the numbers — helps children align digits by place value (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.)
- **A carry row** above the first number — provides space to write carried digits
- **A dotted answer baseline** below the separator line — guides where to write the answer

These guides do not interfere with drawing and can be turned on or off at any time.

---

## Themes

Four visual themes change the app's color scheme without affecting layout:

| Theme | Emoji | Style |
|---|---|---|
| Sky Blue | ☁️ | Light blue — clean and calm (default) |
| Forest | 🌲 | Green tones — nature-inspired |
| Sunset | 🌅 | Warm amber/orange — cozy |
| Lavender | 💜 | Soft purple — gentle |

Tap a theme emoji in the settings bar to switch. The change is immediate.

## Tips for Parents

### Choosing the Right Settings

- **Start with 1 digit, Easy, Addition only** for young beginners (age 5–6)
- **Increase digits gradually** — move from 1 to 2 to 3 as your child gains confidence
- **Add operations one at a time** — master addition before adding subtraction, then multiplication
- **Use Guided Mode** for children learning column addition/subtraction — the place-value lines help with alignment

### Using Session Mode Effectively

- Sessions create focused practice windows with a set number of problems
- The timer helps track how long practice takes, but there is **no time pressure** — let children work at their own pace
- Use the check panel to review answers together after the child finishes
- Discuss incorrect answers as learning opportunities

### Drawing Tips

- On tablets, a **stylus** provides the best writing experience
- **Increase brush size** (slider in the toolbar) if your child's strokes are hard to see
- Use **different colors** to make practice more engaging
- The **undo button** (↩) on each card lets a child fix mistakes without clearing everything

### Offline Use

MathCanvas works entirely offline. No internet connection is required, no data is sent to external servers, and no accounts are needed. All progress data stays on the device.
